### Kuroshio Extension, North Pacific Atmosphere, Northeast Marine Heatwaves

As my doctoral dissertation research I, have been working on how Kuroshio Extension in the North Pacific Ocean influences the atmosphere of the North Pacific by influencing Pacific Decadal Precession - a quasi decadal variability of a pressure dipole over the North Pacific. This work was further extended to determine how Kuroshio influences marine heatwaves in the northeast Pacific. Currently, I am investigating the future of these links in a changing climate.
