# **Hello there, Welcome!**

I am a Doctoral Candidate at **Department of Earth & Environment** at **Boston University**.\
\
I investigate **large-scale ocean atmosphere interactions associated with Kuroshio Extension variations and their linkages with marine heatwaves**, advised by [**Prof. Bruce Anderson.**](https://www.bu.edu/earth/profiles/bruce-anderson/)\

### **Current Highlight**

This summer, I am working as an **Earth System Science Intern** at **National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)** to investigate Kuroshio Extension and atmospheric relations using CESM model data. I am being mentored by [**Dr. Anna-Lena Deppenmeier**](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/deppenme)
