**My story** starts in Sri Lanka, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean. Born and bred in this small island for more than two decades, I studied aquatic science initially. While studying aquatic science in college, I wanted to study the ocean and know more about climate change.\
\
After working for couple of years in two organizations in Sri Lanka (International Water Management Institute & International Union for Conservation of Nature), I ended up pursuing a Master\'s degree in the United States at School for Marine Science & Technology of UMass Dartmouth in Professor Avijit Gangopadhyay\'s Lab. There I studied the seasonality, variability, and survival of Gulf Stream\'s Warm Core Rings.\
\
After completing my MS I joined the Department of Earth & Environment of Boston University to pursue a Ph.D.Â under the advisement of Professor Bruce Anderson. Currently, I am in Boston conducting my dissertation research. For my doctoral thesis I investigate large-scale interactions between the Kuroshio Current and atmosphere. Apart from that I enjoy taking strolls through this beautiful city taking pictures and also hiking in New Hampshire time to time. And enjoy taking road trips exploring the continental United States.
