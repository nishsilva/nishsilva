    "text": "My story starts in Sri Lanka, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean. Born and bred in this small island for more than two decades, I studied aquatic science initially. While studying aquatic science in college, I wanted to study ocean and know more about climate change. After working for couple of years in two organizations (International Water Management Institute & International Union for Conservation of Nature) Sri Lanka I ended up pursuing a Master’s degree in the United States at School for Marine Science of UMass Dartmouth in Professor Avijit Gangopadhyay’s Lab. After completing my MS I joined the Department of Earth & Environment of Boston University to pursue a Ph.D. under the advisement of Professor Bruce Anderson. Currently, I am in Boston doing my dissertation research while enjoying this beautiful city also hiking in New Hampshire time to time."
