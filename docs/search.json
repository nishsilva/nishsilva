    "text": "Who am I?\n\n\n\nMy story starts in Sri Lanka, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean. Born and lived in this small island for more than two decades, I studied aquatic science initially. While studying aquatic science in college, I wanted to study the ocean and know more about climate change.\nAfter working for couple of years in two organizations (International Water Management Institute & International Union for Conservation of Nature) in Sri Lanka I ended up pursuing a Master’s degree in the United States at School for Marine Science of UMass Dartmouth in Professor Avijit Gangopadhyay’s Lab. There I studied the seasonality, variability, and survival of Gulf Stream’s Warm Core Rings.\nAfter completing my MS I joined the Department of Earth & Environment of Boston University to pursue a Ph.D. under the advisement of Professor Bruce Anderson. Currently, I am in Boston conducting my dissertation research. For my doctoral thesis I investigate large-scale interactions between the Kuroshio Current and atmosphere. Apart from that I enjoy taking strolls through this beautiful city taking pictures and also hiking in New Hampshire time to time. And enjoy taking road trips exploring the continental United States.\n\n\nMy Career Path"
