    "text": "Who am I?\n\n\n\nMy story starts in Sri Lanka, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean. Born and lived in this small island for more than two decades, I studied aquatic science initially. While studying aquatic science in college, I wanted to study the ocean and know more about climate change.\nAfter working for couple of years in two organizations (International Water Management Institute & International Union for Conservation of Nature) in Sri Lanka I ended up pursuing a Master’s degree in the United States at School for Marine Science of UMass Dartmouth in Professor Avijit Gangopadhyay’s Lab. There I studied the seasonality, variability, and survival of Gulf Stream’s Warm Core Rings.\nAfter completing my MS, I joined the Department of Earth & Environment of Boston University to pursue a Ph.D. under the advisement of Professor Bruce Anderson. For my doctoral thesis I investigated large-scale interactions between the Kuroshio Current and atmosphere. In the last few months of my Ph.D. I was offered a Senior Research Associate position in the AER Inc’s Oceanography Group. Currently, I am with AER Inc. conducting research on sea level variability. Apart from that I enjoy taking strolls through this beautiful city taking pictures and also hiking in New Hampshire time to time. And enjoy taking road trips exploring the continental United States."

Developed a Survival model to investigate the survival of the Gulf Stream’s Warm Core Rings. Conducted analysis on long-term regime shifts in Gulf Stream’s Warm Core Ring formations. Conducted a georeferenced census for Gulf Stream’s Warm Core Rings.\n\n\nDugong and Seagrass Conservation in the Gulf of Mannar\nAffiliated with Dugong and Seagrass Conservation cross-national project.\nDeveloped and supplied inputs for the determination of a new marine protected area (MPA) in the Gulf of Mannar, Indian Ocean.\nConducted a survey to test the attitude of fishing communities for the conservation of Dugong and Seagrass in Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay, Indian Ocean.\n\n\nMulti Purpose Water Infrasturcture Management in Central Asia\nDeveloped a repository of muti-purpose water infrastructure case studies to utilize as an input for a policy model established for the management of reservoirs in Kazakhstan.\n\n\nWater Resources Management in South Asia and Africa\nAnalyzed hydrological data for ten different climate change scenarios produced as a SWAT model output to understand the hydrological impacts of climate change in the Tana River basin, Kenya.\nStudied the potential of utilizing groundwater and surface water conjunctively for irrigation in an agricultural development scheme in North-Central Sri Lanka.\nProcessed a geo-coded agro-well database to calculate potential cropping intensities for an agricultural development scheme in North-Central Sri Lanka.\nContributed to a case study on small-scale hydropower generation and its implications on mountain streams in Sri Lanka"
